# Development Documentation

## AI Developer Requirements
CRITICAL: These requirements ensure reliable and professional development practices:

1. Documentation Requirements:
   - EVERY development action MUST be documented in this file IMMEDIATELY
   - NO relying on AI memories alone
   - ALL configuration changes must include:
     * What was changed
     * Why it was changed
     * When it was changed
     * How to verify the change

2. Verification Requirements:
   - EVERY GitHub push must be verified
   - ALL configuration changes must be tested
   - Changes must be documented BEFORE being marked as complete

3. Communication Requirements:
   - Developer must proactively suggest best practices
   - Developer must flag potential issues or concerns
   - Developer must maintain professional standards at all times
   - NO assumptions about what the founder knows or doesn't know

4. Accountability:
   - Developer must admit mistakes immediately
   - Developer must correct documentation promptly
   - Developer must verify previous work at the start of each session

## Project Setup History

### Initial Setup (July 22, 2025)
1. Cloned repository (without forking first)
2. Created fork at https://github.com/nugecom/SaaS-Boilerplate
3. Added fork as remote: `git remote add myfork https://github.com/nugecom/SaaS-Boilerplate.git`
4. Configured git identity:
   - Email: john@nugent.co
   - Username: nugecom
5. Installed VS Code extensions:
   - ESLint
   - Dotenv
   - PostCSS Language Support
   - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
   - Vitest Explorer
   - REST Client
   - Pretty TypeScript Errors
   - Playwright Test for VSCode
   - GitHub Actions
   - i18n Ally
6. Set up GitHub configurations:
   - Configured Dependabot for critical security updates
   - Added security testing workflow
   - Optimized notification settings for non-technical founder workflow

### Current Configuration Files
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Security updates configuration
- `.github/workflows/security-updates.yml` - Automated testing for security updates
- Other inherited workflows from boilerplate (CI, checkly, crowdin, release)

## Development Decisions
1. Local folder as single source of truth
2. Force push to GitHub when needed (we're not collaborating with others yet)
3. Focus on startup-appropriate configurations and practices

## Maintenance Procedures
- Weekly security updates review
- Dependencies update schedule
- Backup verification process

## Technical Debt Tracking
(To be updated as we identify areas needing improvement)

## Project Conventions
1. All significant changes must be documented in this file
2. Use clear numbering/lettering conventions in documentation (no duplicate systems)
3. Always verify GitHub pushes
4. Document all development decisions and their reasoning
